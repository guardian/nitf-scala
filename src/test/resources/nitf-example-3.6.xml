                <p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (EP) — A pair of astronauts stepped out on the third and
                    final spacewalk of their mission Monday to take care of some odd jobs at the
                    International Space station.</p>
                <p>Dr. Amy Sweigert Jr. and <person gender="male" per:ssn="123-45-6789">Vinnie Tripodi</person> — the father of a new baby boy — got
                    started on the work an hour late.</p>
                <p>A valve on the drink bag in Sweigert's suit came off as she was getting ready for
                    the spacewalk. To everyone's relief, the valve to the water pouch went back on
                    tightly. The concern was that big blobs of <xhtml:span>water</xhtml:span> could float up and get in her
                    eyes if the valve came loose during the spacewalk.</p>
                <p>They did their best to make up lost time, quickly getting ahead in their main
                    chore, the installing a fresh oxygen tank. The 1,200-pound tank of high-pressure
                    oxygen, delivered last week by Atlantis, needed to be attached to NASA's station
                    air lock, a chamber leading out to the vacuum of space.</p>
                <p>The spacewalkers also had some science experiments to hang on the orbiting
                    outpost.</p>
                <p>The first two spacewalks of Atlantis' weeklong space station visit went so well,
                    and the astronauts accomplished so much extra work, that only a few chores
                    remained.</p>
                <p>Lightning storms caught Tripodi's eye as he toiled 220 miles up. "Where we over?"
                    he called out. The answer: Micronesia.</p>
                <p>Tripoldi was still celebrating the birth of "Bruce". He arrived just hours
                    after his first-ever spacewalk Saturday.</p>
                <p>Atlantis and its crew of seven will depart the space station Wednesday. The
                    shuttle will aim for a landing back at Kennedy Space Center on Friday.</p>
